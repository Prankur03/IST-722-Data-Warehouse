### About data
Fudgemart is a conglomerate that is providing online retailing services similar to amazon, Walmart etc. by the name of fudgemart along with the streaming services to the customers in the name of fudgeflix.  Both have their separate databases and functions.

### Business requirements 
For the business process, we will be focusing on the order fulfillment of the services with the aim to find the duration it takes to ship a product once the order has been placed. 

### Business goals
Our work is focused on 3 things:
•	Providing a consolidated view of our order fulfillment data across the 2 subsdiaries.
•	Identifying the departments and products for which order fulfillment can be improved.
•	Identifying the geographic locations from which the organization can improve upon the order fulfillment process.

### Answering some questions
In order to achieve these goals, we will try to answer some the following questions like:
•	Do orders that are to be fulfilled in certain customer locations take longer to ship?
•	Which customer locations receive the maximum number of orders? 
•	Which Product Departments receive the maximum number of orders?

### To be prdicted
•	Do certain Products & Product Departments take longer to ship?
•	Do orders with higher order quantity take longer to ship? 

### How was it accomplished?
• Built a business intelligence solution for a fictional conglomerate with two subsidiary companies.
• Designed a detailed dimensional model to integrate data from disparate sources into a single data warehouse.
• Built a data warehouse modeled after the star schema using SQL.
• Used SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract, transform and load (ETL) data into the warehouse.
• Performed analysis to gain insights into and make recommendations regarding the order fulfillment process using Power BI and Excel.
